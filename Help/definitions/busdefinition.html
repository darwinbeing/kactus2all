    <h2>Bus Definition</h2>
    <p>
        Bus definitions are a part of the IP-XACT and they are used to define bus connections in HW designs.
        <p>
            An abstraction definition can also be linked with a bus definition to provide additional validation
            for bus connections. Abstraction definition defines what logical signals must be present in the bus
            interface in order for the bus connection with such abstraction definition to be valid.

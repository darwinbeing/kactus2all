		<h2>File set editor</h2>
		<p>
			File set editor can be used to edit the details of a single file set and to add and 
			remove files contained in the file set. File sets can be used to group files together 
			to be referenced by other sections of a component.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the top the name, display name and description of the file set are shown. 
			Name is used to identify the file set within a component and the description contains 
			a textual description of the file set.
		</p>
		<p>
			The files group box lists the files contained in the file set. File name contains the 
			name of the file and file path displays the relative file path from the component’s xml-file 
			to the file. File types column displays the file types defined for the file and the description 
			contains the textual description of a single file. The file types and description columns are 
			editable but the file name and file path are not. The “Add Files” button opens a dialog that 
			can be used to select files on the disk to add to the file set.
		</p>
		<p>
			The files box also contains a context menu that has the following options:
			<ul>
				<li>Add new file to the file set (Add row)</li>
				<li>Remove file from file set (Remove row)</li>
				<li>Clear the selected cells</li>
				<li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
				<li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
				<li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
				<li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			If a file is in invalid state, i.e. missing a mandatory file type, then the file is 
			displayed in red color. The order of files is maintained and can be changed by dragging rows. 
			If the compilation order of files is important then the files should be listed in order needed 
			by compilation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The default build command can be used to define commands how to build files of the specified 
			file types. The file type column displays a file type and the command and flags columns display 
			the build command and the flags set for the associated file type. The replace default flags 
			column defines if the flags are appended to the current flags or shall replace the existing 
			flags of a build command. The build commands editor contains a similar context menu as the files editor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Group identifiers can contain several identifiers and the possible words are not limited. 
			However the editor suggests the following options for the group identifiers:
			<ul>
				<li>Diagnostics</li>
				<li>Documentation</li>
				<li>ProjectFiles</li>
				<li>Simulation</li>
				<li>sourceFiles</li>
			</ul>
			These identifiers can be used to describe the purpose of the file set.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dependent directories can be used to describe a list of paths to directories containing 
			files on which the file set depends.

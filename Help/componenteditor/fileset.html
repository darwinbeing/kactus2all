    <h2>File set editor</h2>
    <p>
      File set editor can be used to edit the details of a single file
      set and to add and remove files contained in the file set. File
      sets can be used to group files together to be referenced by
      other sections of a component.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Name</b>, <b>display name</b>, and <b>description</b> of the
      file set are shown on top. Name is mandatory as it identifies
      the file set within a component. Display name is typically a few
      words providing a more detailed and/or user-friendly name for
      display. Description contains a textual description of the file
      set.
    </p>
    <h3>Files</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Files</b> group box lists the files contained in the file set.
      Each file has a <b>name</b> identifying the file. The file name is mandatory, and it is given when adding
      file.
      <br /><b>File path</b> is defined either as relative to the component's xml-file or as an absolute path.
      The file path is mandatory and it is given when adding files.
      <br /><b>File type</b> links files to their build command (see below). One file can have many types. File
      type is mandatory.
      <br /><b>Description</b> is a freely formatted text describing a single file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Add Files</b> button opens a dialog to select files on the disk to add to the file set. The order of
      files is maintained and can be changed by dragging rows. If the compilation order of files is important
      then the files should be listed in order needed by compilation.
      <br>If a file is in <font color="red">invalid state</font>, i.e. missing a mandatory file type, then the
      file is displayed in <font color="red">red color</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The files box also contains a context menu (right mouse button)
      that has the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add new file to the file set (Add row)</li>
      <li>Remove file from file set (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
      <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
      <li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Default build commands</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Default build command</b> can define <b>command</b> and <b>flags</b> to build files, e.g. running gcc
      for C files or vcom for VHDL. <b>File type</b> must macth the file table above. The defined command can
      either <b>replace default flags</b> or be appended to it. This table has a similar context menu as the
      files editor.
    </p>
    <h3>Group identifiers</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Group identifier</b> can be used to describe the function or purpose of the file with a single
      unbounded word. <i>Group</i> identifiers can contain several identifiers and the possible words are not
      limited.  However the editor suggests the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Diagnostics</li>
      <li>Documentation</li>
      <li>ProjectFiles</li>
      <li>Simulation</li>
      <li>sourceFiles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dependent directories</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Dependent directories</b> can specify a freetext list of paths to directories on which this file
      set depends, e.g. directories of include files.

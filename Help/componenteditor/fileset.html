		<h2>File set editor</h2>
		<p>
			File set editor can be used to edit the details of a single file set and to add and 
			remove files contained in the file set. File sets can be used to group files together 
			to be referenced by other sections of a component.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Name</b>, <b>display name</b>, and
			<b>description</b> of the file set are shown
			on top. Name is mandatory as it identifies the
			file set within a component. Display name is
			typically a few words providing a more
			detailed and/or user-friendly name for
			display. Description contains a textual
			description of the file set.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Files</b> group box lists the files
			contained in the file set. Each file has of
			course the <b>name</b>.  <b> File path</b> is
			defined relative to the component's
			xml-file. <b>File type</b> links files to
			their build command (see below). One file can
			have many types.  <b>Description</b> is a
			freely formatted text describing a single
			file.

                        The file types and description columns are
                        editable but the file name and file path are
                        not. <br/> <b>Add Files</b> button opens a
                        dialog to select files on the disk to add to
                        the file set.  The order of files is
                        maintained and can be changed by dragging
                        rows. If the compilation order of files is
                        important then the files should be listed in
                        order needed by compilation.  <br/> If a file
                        is in <font color="red">invalid state</font>,
                        i.e. missing a mandatory file type, then the
                        file is displayed in <font color="red">red
                        color</font>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The files box also contains a context menu
			(right mouse button) that has the following
			options:
			<ul>
				<li>Add new file to the file set (Add row)</li>
				<li>Remove file from file set (Remove row)</li>
				<li>Clear the selected cells</li>
				<li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
				<li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
				<li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
				<li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Default build command</b> can define
			<b>command</b> and <b>flags</b> to build
			files, e.g. running gcc for C files or vcom
			for VHDL. <b>File type</b> must macth the file
			table above. The defined command can either
			<b>replace default flags</b> or be appended to
			it. This table has a similar context menu as
			the files editor.
		</p>
		<p>
                        <b>Group identifier</b> can be used to
                        describe the function or purpose of the file
                        with a single unbounded word. <i>Group</i>
                        identifiers can contain several identifiers
                        and the possible words are not limited.
                        However the editor suggests the following
                        options:
			<ul>
				<li>Diagnostics</li>
				<li>Documentation</li>
				<li>ProjectFiles</li>
				<li>Simulation</li>
				<li>sourceFiles</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Dependent directories</b> can specify a
			freetext list of paths to directories on which
			this file set depends, e.g. directories of
			include files.

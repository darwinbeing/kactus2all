		<h2>File editor</h2>
		<p>
			File editor can be used to edit the details of a single file within a file set.
		</p>
		<p>
			The name field contains the relative file path from the containing component’s xml-file 
			to the file. The file types list is used to specify the type of the file. File type can 
			be used i.e. when specifying build commands for files. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The logical name of a file can be used i.e. to specify a VHDL library for a VHDL-file. 
			If the "only used as default"-check box is checked then the logical name is only used as 
			default and can be overridden by another process.
		</p>
		<p>
			The “is include file” and “contains external declarations” -check boxes can be used to 
			specify the file is an include file and that the file contains external declarations and 
			is needed by other files in this file set.
		</p>
		<p>
			Description contains the textual description of the file and the build command can be used 
			to define a specific build command or –flags for this file. If the “replace default flags”-check box 
			is checked then the default flags of the build script are replaced, if not then the flags are
			appended to the default flags. Target name is used to specify a path to the file that is derived
			from this file when build process is run.

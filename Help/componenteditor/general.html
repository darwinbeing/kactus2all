		<h2>General editor</h2>
		<p>
			General editor contains the general information of a component, such as description.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the top of the editor the VLNV-identifier and the file path to the xml-file are shown. 
			These fields can’t be modified and if user wants to change the VLNV then the component must 
			be saved as new component with new VLNV. Kactus attributes contain the hierarchy, firmness and 
			implementation of which the implementation can’t be modified.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Attributes are a Kactus2-specific extension to the IP-Xact standard and their purpose is explained below:
			<table border="1">
				<tr>
					<th>Attribute name</th>
					<th>Attribute value</th>
					<th>Value description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="6">Product hierarchy</td>
					<td>Global</td>
					<td>Component does not fit into any other category.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Product</td>
					<td>Component represents a final product.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Board</td>
					<td>Component represents develoment- or final hardware platform i.e. a circuit board.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Chip</td>
					<td>Component represents a chip i.e. some specific FPGA-chip.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>SoC</td>
					<td>Component represents a system on chip.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>IP</td>
					<td>Component represents a single IP-block.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="3">Implementation</td>
					<td>HW</td>
					<td>Component is hardware implementation.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>SW</td>
					<td>Component is a software implementation.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>SYS</td>
					<td>Component contains information about the software component mapping to the underlaying hardware platform.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="4"> Firmness</td>
					<td>Template</td>
					<td>Component is a model that can be used as a base when creating new components to the library but must not be used as such.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Mutable</td>
					<td>Component is fully modifiable.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Parametrizable</td>
					<td>Component contains parameters that can be used to configure it but it can't be modified further.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Fixed</td>
					<td>Component can’t be configured in any way and it is frozen to it's final state.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</p>
		<p>
			Description text box can be used to store a textual description of the component.
		</p>
		<p>
			The component preview box on the bottom displays how the component will look like when 
			instantiated in a design. The preview displays the bus interfaces of the component and 
			also the ports that are marked to be seen as ad-Hoc-ports.

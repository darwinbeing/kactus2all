    <h2>Address space editor</h2>
    <p>
      Address space editor can be used to edit the details of an
      address space within component.  <i>Address space</i> defines a
      logical address space seen by a master bus interface. It can be
      split into smaller <i>sgements</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left side are the editor fields that can be used to set
      the details of an address space.  The right side has a
      visualization displaying the address space in its current state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Address space has a <b>name</b> and textual <b>description</b>.
      <b>Display name</b> can be more detailed or user-friendly than
      name, but usually only a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general group contains the same settings that can be set through the address spaces summary.
      <br /><b>Addressable unit size</b> specifies the number of bits each address increment contains, e.g.
      8 bits or 32 bits.
      <br /><b>Range</b> is the size of the address space expressed as addressable units, i.e. the number of
      separate addresses.
      <br /><b>Width</b> is the data width of a row in bits. It defines the maximum size for a single transfer.
    </p>
    <h3>Segments</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Segments</b> editor can be used to describe portions of the address space, i.e. split it into smaller
      segments.
      <br />Each segment has the starting <b>offset</b> address, range (size) as number of AUBs, and textual
      <b>description</b>. The visualization on the right side reacts to the changes and displays how the
      segments are situated in the address space. Mismatches, e.g. sum of segment ranges being greater than
      address block range, can be easily spotted from the visualization.
    </p>
    <h3>Local memory map</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Local memory map</b> is optional but some processors require specifying a memory map that is local
      to the component.  This consists of <b>Address blocks</b> similarly to the memory map of a slave
      interface. Hence, address blocks can contain either memory or registers, and registers can contain bit
      fields. Local memory map is useful for storing the programmer's view to interrupts registers, timers,
      and other local things. The overall address space of a component is a concatenation of local memory map
      (e.g. timers) and the memory maps of other units (e.g. registers of accelerator A, registers of
      accelerator B etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The address block editor can be used to define address blocks for the address space. The editor is
      similar to the address block editor in memory maps.
    </p>
    <p>Tag <i>executableImage</i> is not supported yet. IP-XACT
    standard allows defining an executable software image to be loaded
    into a processors address space, and also the commands to build
    it.

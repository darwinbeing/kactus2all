    <h2>Address spaces editor</h2>
    <p>
      Address spaces editor contains the summary of the address spaces
      of the component. This editor can be used to add and remove
      address spaces to the containing component. Editor enables user
      also to set the general information of an address space.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Double-click adds a new row.  <i>Address space</i> defines the
      addressable memory space that can be accessed via a <i>master
      interface</i>. In other words, it is the programmer's view to
      the rest of the system. <br>Note that address space is actually
      instance-specific concepts (what other units are there and what
      are their addresses) than component-specific. Nevertheless,
      IP-XACT standard defines address space inside a component,
      although it is seldom a reusable thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Address space has a <b>name</b> and textual <b>description</b>.
      <br /><b>Addressable unit size</b> specifies the number of bits each address increment contains, e.g. 8
      bits or 32 bits.
      <br /><b>Range</b> meanss the size of the address space expressed as addressable units. In other words,
      it is the number of separate addresses.
      <br /><b>Width</b> is the data width of a row in bits. It defines the maximum size for a single transfer.
      <br /><b>Master interface binding</b> ties the address space to some master interface but this can also
      be left blank.

		<h2>Bus interface editor</h2>
		<p>
			Bus interfaces editor is used to edit the details of a single bus interface. Bus interface is used to group 
			ports together to form an interface that i.e. fulfills requirements for a bus protocol. 
			The editor contains two tabs: the general tab which is used to set the general settings of the interface and 
			the port maps tab which is used to group ports to the interface.
		</p>
		<p>
			The name and description contain the name and textual description of the bus interface.
			Bus definition and abstraction definition contain VLNV-references to the bus definition and abstraction 
			definition IP-Xact documents that are associated with this interface. Those documents define the qualities 
			that this bus interface must meet. For example the abstraction definition defines the logical signals that belong to the bus. 
			These logical signals are used to define how the physical ports of the component are connected in the bus, 
			this is explained in the help page of port maps editor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Interface mode combo box selects the interface mode of the bus interface.
			Below the combo box are the interface mode-specific fields that are used to edit options of the currently selected interface mode.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the general group the addressable unit size defines how many bits are included in the least addressable unit of the bus.
			The default setting is byte addressable (8 bits). The endianness indicates whether the interface is big-endian or little-endian.
			The bit steering can be set to on or off. The bit steering on implies that the interface is able to align data on different
			byte channels in case of addressable interfaces. The default setting when the bit steering is not set is off. 
			When checked the connection required indicates that when instantiated in a design, this interface must be connected to
			some other interface and canâ€™t be left unconnected.

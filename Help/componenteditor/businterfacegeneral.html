    <h2>Bus interface editor</h2>
    <p>
      Bus interfaces editor is used to edit the details of a single
      bus interface. <i>Bus interface</i> is used to group ports
      together to form an interface that i.e. fulfills requirements
      for a bus protocol. The editor contains two tabs: the
      <b>general</b> tab which is used to set the general settings of
      the interface, and the <b>port maps</b> tab which is used to
      group ports to the interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bus interface has a mandatory <b>name</b> and textual
      description.  <br><b>Bus definition</b> and <b>abstraction
      definition</b> contain <i>VLNV</i>-references to IP-XACT
      documents that are associated with this interface. They define
      the qualities that this bus interface must meet. Bus definition
      is actually very small. The abstraction definition defines the
      <i>logical signals</i> and port maps define how they are
      connected to component's ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Interface mode</b> combo box has 7 choices:
      'direct'/'mirrored' 'master', 'slave', and 'system', as well as
      'monitor'.  Settings in the bottom are interface mode-specific
      and change when mode changes. For example, <i>master</i> and
      <i>mirroredMaster</i> have address space settings, whereas
      <i>slave</i> has memory map and bridge settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>General</b> settings include <b>addressable unit size</b>
      which defines how many bits are included in the least
      addressable unit of the bus.  The default setting is byte
      addressable (8 bits). <b>Endianness</b> indicates whether the
      interface is 'big-endian' or 'little-endian' (default).  <b>Bit
      steering</b>='on' implies that the interface is able to
      dynamically align data on different byte channels in case of
      addressable interfaces. The default setting when the bit
      steering is not set is off. <b>Connection required</b> indicates
      that when instantiated in a design, this interface must be
      connected to some other interface and cannot be left
      unconnected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Parameters</b> are optional and can specify any parameter
      data value(s) for this bus interface.

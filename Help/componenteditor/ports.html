		<h2>Ports editor</h2>
		<p>
			Ports editor provides a table containing all the ports of a component. This editor is used to add, remove and edit the ports.
		</p>
		<p>
			Port name identifies each port and must match the name of the port in the implementation language. 
			For example in case of VHDL the ports listed in the entity declaration are to be listed here. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The direction columns specifies the direction of the port and has four options:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>in</strong> for input ports.</li>
				<li><strong>out</strong> for output ports.</li>
				<li><strong>inout</strong> for bidirectional and tri-state ports.</li>
				<li><strong>phantom</strong> for ports that exist on the IP-Xact component but not on the implementation.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The left and right bound define the width of the port in case of vectored ports. The width of the port is
			left bound â€“ right bound + 1. In case of scalar ports the left bound = right bound.
		</p>
		<p>
			The port type specifies the type of the port. In case of VHDL the typical values for scalar and vectored ports are 
			std_logic and std_logic_vector. The type definition is a language specific reference to where the type is defined. 
			In previous example the type defition is IEEE.std_logic_1164.all. In case of SystemC the type definition is the include 
			file name, i.e. systemc.h. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The default value is used to assign a default value for an unconnected port. For example this is used when generating
			a structural vhdl for the top-level hierarchical component to assign values to input ports that are not connected to 
			any other port in the design. The description contains a textual description of the port.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ad-Hoc column is a Kactus2-specific extension which is used in the graphical user interface of a hierarchical design.<br/>
			<img src="adHocPorts.png" alt="Component instance with ad-Hoc ports"><br/>
			The component instances are drawn as rectangles and their external interfaces are drawn to the edges of the rectangle. 
			In this case the instance has 5 bus interfaces: clk, led, rst_n, from_hibi and pkt_codec. Normally this is all that
			user sees of the interfaces of a component but if user selects ports to be shown as ad-Hoc then those ports are shown also.
			Figure above displays two ad-Hoc ports: rx_av_in and led_out, the directions of the ports can also be seen by the port icon.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ports editor provides a context menu that contains following options:
			<ul>
				<li>Add new port (Add row)</li>
				<li>Remove port (Remove row)</li>
				<li>Clear the selected cells</li>
				<li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
				<li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
				<li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
				<li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Bus interfaces editor</h2>
		<p>
			The bus interfaces editor displays a summary of the bus interfaces of a component. Bus interface is used to 
			group ports together to form an interface that i.e. fulfills requirements for a bus protocol. 
			This editor is used to add and remove bus interfaces in a component.
		</p>
		<p>
			The name and description columns contain the name and textual description of the bus interface. 
			The interface column is used to select the interface mode of a bus interface.
			<dl> There are seven different interface modes:
				<dt><strong>Master</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that the interface is the one that initiates transactions.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Slave</strong></dt>
				<dd>- is the one that responds to transactions.</dd>
				<dt><strong>System</strong></dt>
				<dd>- can be used for some interfaces that do not fit into the master or slave category.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Mirrored slave</strong></dt>
				<dd>- is the mirrored version of slave interface and may provide address offsets to the connected slave interfaces.</dd>	
				<dt><strong>Mirrored master</strong></dt>
				<dd>- is the mirrored version of master interface.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Mirrored system</strong></dt>
				<dd>- is the mirrored version of system interface.</dd>				
				<dt><strong>Monitor</strong></dt>
				<dd>- is an interface that can be used for verification process. This interface type gathers data from other interfaces.</dd>				
			</dl>
			The idea of mirrored interfaces is that they have the same ports as the normal interfaces but the directions of the ports are inverted.
		</p>
		<p>
			The bus definition and abstraction definition columns are not editable and they display the VLNV-identifiers of the 
			IP-Xact documents that define qualities of the hardware bus that the interface fulfills. These fields can be set in the
			bus interface-specific editor.

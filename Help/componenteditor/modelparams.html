    <h2>Model parameters editor</h2>
    <p>
      Model parameters editor can be used to add, remove and modify
      the model parameters of a component.  Model parameters are often
      used in HDL configure component instances. They represent e.g VHDL 
      generics and Verilog module parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      All columns of the editor are editable.  Double-clicking an empty
      space adds a new row.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Name</b> column is mandatory. <b>Display name</b> provides a
      more user-friendly name for the model parameter. <b>Description</b> 
	  is free text for further details.
    </p>
	<p>
	  Legal <b>data type</b> depends on the language of the model. For 
	  example in VHDL this could be 'integer' or 'std_logic', whereas in 
	  C-language int or 'char*' could be used. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>OO usage</b> specifies how this model parameter
	  is used. Default is 'non-typed' since such parameters are found in all
	  languages, i.e. all VHDL types are non-typed. 'Typed' parameters appear
	  in object-oriented languages, i.e. in C++.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Type</b> is the type to which the model parameter value resolves. 
      Possible types are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>bit</b> indicates that the value shall resolve to a System Verilog bit,
		which by default is resolved to a 1-bit value, unless a vector size has been 
		specified.</li>

        <li><b>byte</b> indicates that the value shall resolve to a System Verilog byte,
		which is resolved to an 8-bit integer value.</li>

        <li><b>shortint</b> indicates that the value shall resolve to a System Verilog shortint,
		which is resolved to a 16-bit integer value.</li>
		
		<li><b>int</b> indicates that the value shall resolve to a System Verilog int, which
		is resolved to a 32-bit integer value.</li>
		
		<li><b>longint</b> indicates that the value shall resolve to a System Verilog longint,
		which is resolved to a 64-bit integer value.</li>
		
		<li><b>shortreal</b> indicates that the value shall resolve to a System Verilog
		shorint, which is resolved to a 32-bit floating point value. Both standard and 
		scientific format (e.g 0.002 and 2e-3) are supported. This type applies also to
		<b>minimum value</b> and <b>maximum value</b>.</li>
		
		<li><b>real</b> indicates that the value shall resolve to a System Verilog shortreal,
		which is resolved to a 64-bit floating point value. Both standard and scientific 
		format (e.g. 0.002 and 2e-3) are supported. This type applies also to 
		<b>minimum value</b> and <b>maximum value</b>.</li>
		
		<li><b>string</b> indicates that the value shall contain any text.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By selecting a <b>choice</b>, the user can restrict the allowed model 
      parameter values to a set of predefined values. Possible values
      are defined in the choices of the containing component.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Value</b> contains the mandatory default value of the model parameter. 
	  This value can be overridden in a design that instantiates this component.
	  f(x) means that the value can be given as an equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Minimum value</b> and <b>maximum value</b> define the lower and upper
      boundary for the model parameter value. If the selected type is <b>bit</b>
	  or <b>string</b>, these fields have no effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Resolve</b> specifies the configuration of the model parameter. 
      Possible resolve values are:
    </p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>immediate</b> indicates that the the value is defined
        within the containing component. The value cannot be overridden
        by the user or a generator in design configuration. This is the 
		default value</li>

        <li><b>user</b> indicates that the user can override the
        default value in design configuration. Generators are not 
        allowed to change the value.</li>

        <li><b>generated</b> indicates that the a generator can
        override the default value in design configuration.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Bit width</b> defines the length of the bit string that stores the value.
	  f(x) means that the value can be given as an equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Array size</b> specifies the array dimension for the model
      parameter in an output language e.g. Verilog.
	  f(x) means that the value can be given as an equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Array offset</b> specifies the starting point in the array
      dimension in an output language e.g. Verilog.
	  f(x) means that the value can be given as an equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Model parameters editor contains a context menu (rigth mouse
      button) that has the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add new model parameter (Add row)</li>
      <li>Remove model parameter (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
      <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
      <li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
    </ul>

      EXAMPLE. Figure shows the relation between VHDL and model
      parameter editor. Note that IP-XACT requires default value even
      if VHDL does not.

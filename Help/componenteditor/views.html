    <h2>Views editor</h2>
    <p>
      Views editor provides a summary of the views of the
      component. The editor can be used to add and remove views.
      <i>View</i> specifies a representation level of a component,
      e.g. there might be different views for simulation and
      synthesis. Component must have at least 1 view. It can also have
      many views and one of them activated when component is
      instantiated in a <i>design</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Name</b> and <b>description</b> columns are editable here but
      <b> view type</b> is not. It defines whether the view is
      <i>hierarchical</i> or not, and it is set on the view's setting
      page. Hierarchical view contains a reference to a <i>design</i>
      or <i>design configuration</i> which instantiates sub-components
      and connects them together. <i>Non-hierarchical</i> views refers
      to 1 or multiple file sets within the containing component.

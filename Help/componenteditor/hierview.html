		<h2>Hierarchical view editor</h2>
		<p>
			Hierarchical view editor is used to edit the details of a hierarchical view of the component.
			User may change the type of the view thus changing the editor type between this editor and the flat view editor.
		</p>
		<p>
			The name and description fields are used to edit the name and textual description of the view. 
			Environment identifiers specify information about the tool environment of the view. The view type is used to 
			select between flat view editor and hierarchical view editor. These fields mentioned are common with flat editor 
			and hierarchical editor. The rest of the fields are specific for hierarchical views.
		</p>
		<p>
			The hierarchy reference contains a VLNV-reference to a design configuration or design document.
			These documents list the sub-components instantiated in the hierarchical design and their configurations.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reference to a top-level implementation view is a Kactus2-specific extension and is used to reference 
			to a non-hierarchical view that contains the rtl-implementation of the component. Usually this means that component
			contains a non-hierarchical view which contains the top-level structural vhdl where the sub-components are instantiated 
			in code level. This extension refers to the view so the source codes of this component are also included i.e. when 
			generating a compilation script for simulation or synthesis.

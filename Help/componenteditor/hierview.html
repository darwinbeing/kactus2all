    <h2>Hierarchical view editor</h2>
    <p>
      Hierarchical view editor is used to edit the details of a
      hierarchical view of the component. The top part of the editor
      is identical with hierarchical view. User may change the <b>view
      type</b> and then the bottom part changes accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      View has <b>name</b> and textual <b>description</b>. <b>Display
      name</b> can be more detailed or user-friendly than name, but
      usually only few words.
    </p>
    <p>
    <p>
      <b>Environment identifiers</b> in mandatory textual information
      about how this view deployed in tool
      environment. <b>Language</b> indicates this view may be
      compatible with a particular tool, but only if that language is
      supported in that tool, e.g., different versions of some
      simulators may support two or more languages. <b>Tool</b>
      indicates that this view contains tool-information, e.g., HDL
      models that use simulator-specific extensions. The tool can have
      a generic value such as "*Simulation" and
      "*Synthesis"<b>VendorSpecific</b> can further qualify tool and
      language compatibility, e.g. if some appropriate simulator mode
      must be enabled.
      </p>
    <p>
     <b>View type</b> can be changed and a non-hierarchical view has 2
     additional settings. 
	   <ul>
		<li><b>Hierarchy reference</b> is a mandatory
		<i>VLNV</i>-reference to a <i>design configuration</i> or
		<i>design document</i>. These documents list the sub-components
		instantiated in the hierarchical design and their configurations.
		User can simply drag-and-drop appropriate design from IP library
		over the fields, or type them. Kactus2 has also a graphical
		design editor where the user instantiate and configure components
		very easily.<li>
		
		<li><img src="../images/appicon.png" alt="kactus logo">
		<b>Reference to a top-level implementation view</b> is a 
		Kactus2-specific extension. It is a reference to a 
		<i>non-hierarchical view</i> of the same component that contains 
		the generated RTL codes. A <i>design</i> in Kactus2 is graphical 
		block diagram with sub-components and Kactus2 can automatically 
		generate top-level structural VHDL from it. This extension ensures 
		that generated codes are automatically included when generating a 
		compilation script for simulation or synthesis.</li>

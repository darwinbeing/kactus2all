		<h2>Memory map editor</h2>
		<p>
			Memory map editor can be used to edit the details of a memory map by defining address blocks
			inside a single memory map. An address block specifies a single contiguous block of memory 
			within containing memory map.
		</p>
		<p>
			Usage column is used to specify the usage of the address block. The possible values are:
			<ul>
				<li>Memory specifies the address block as memory.</li>
				<li>Register specifies the entire block to contain registers.</li>
				<li>Reserved specifies the entire block as reserved for unknown usage.</li>
			</ul>
			The only type that may contain registers is the usage type of register.
		</p>
		<p>
			Address block name contains the name and description the textual description of the address block. 
			Base address specifies the starting address for the address block. It is expressed in addressing 
			units from the containing memory map. Range of the address block is also expressed as addressing
			units and specifies how many units the block contains. Width is the bit width of a row in the address block.
		</p>
		<p>
			The access column is used to specify the accessibility of the block. The possible values are:
			<ul>
				<li>Read-write</li>
				<li>Read-only</li>
				<li>Write-only</li>
				<li>Read-writeOnce</li>
				<li>writeOnce</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Value true in volatile column indicates that the stored value may change without assigning a 
			write operation. For example a register may change its value in case of an interrupt.

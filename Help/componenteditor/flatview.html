		<h2>Flat view editor</h2>
		<p>
			Flat view editor is used to edit the non-hierarchical views of a component. 
			User may change the type of the view thus changing the editor type between this editor and the hierarchical view editor.
		</p>
		<p>
			The name and description fields are used to edit the name and textual description of the view.
			Environment identifiers specify information about the tool environment of the view. The view type is used to 
			select between flat view editor and hierarchical view editor. These fields mentioned are common with flat
			editor and hierarchical editor. The rest of the fields are specific for non-hierarchical views.
		</p>
		<p>
			Language specifies the HDL for the view, i.e. this may be vhdl or verilog. Model name is a language-specific 
			and therefore depends on the implementation language of the field. For VHDL this may be a configuration name or 
			the entity(architecture) name.
		</p>
		<p>
			File set references contain a list of file set names within the containing component that this view uses.
			Default file build commands contains a list of build commands and flags for the files contained in the file sets 
			referenced through the file sets.

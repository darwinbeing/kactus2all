    <h2>Non-hierarchical (flat) view editor</h2>
    <p>
      Flat view editor is used to edit the non-hierarchical views of a
      component. The top part of the editor is identical with
      hierarchical view. User may change the <b>view type</b> and then
      the bottom part changes accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      View has <b>name</b> and textual <b>description</b>. <b>Display
      name</b> can be more detailed or user-friendly than name, but
      usually only few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Environment identifiers</b> in mandatory textual information
      about how this view deployed in tool
      environment. <b>Language</b> indicates this view may be
      compatible with a particular tool, but only if that language is
      supported in that tool, e.g., different versions of some
      simulators may support two or more languages. <b>Tool</b>
      indicates that this view contains tool-information, e.g., HDL
      models that use simulator-specific extensions. The tool can have
      a generic value such as "*Simulation" and
      "*Synthesis"<b>VendorSpecific</b> can further qualify tool and
      language compatibility, e.g. if some appropriate simulator mode
      must be enabled.
    <p>
      <b>View type</b> can be changed and a non-hierarchical view has
      5 additional optional settings.
	  <ul>
		<li><b>Language</b> specifies the HDL for the view, e.g. VHDL, 
		Verilog, or SystemC. b>Strict</b> denotes if language shall 
		be strictly enforced. The default is false (unchecked). </li>
	  
		<li><b>Model name</b> is an optional language-specific 
		identifier. For example, this may be of form
		<i>entity(architecture)</i> if <b>name</b>-field of the VLNV
		is not exactly the same as the entity name in VHDL code, or 
		this may be VHDL <i>configuration</i> name. For SystemC, this 
		is the <i>sc_module</i> class name.</li>
		
		<li><b>File set references</b> lists the used file sets of the
		containing component, e.g. hdl_sources. </li>
		
		<li><b>Default file build commands</b> lists the <b>commands</b> 
		and <b>flags</b> to compile the files of the listed file sets.</li>
		
		<li><b>Parameters</b> are optional details that describe the view 
		for <i>generator</i> usage.	</li>
	  </ul>

		<h2>Address block editor</h2>
		<p>
			Address block editor is used to edit the details of an address block by defining registers to it. 
			Each row in the editor specifies a single register within the containing address block.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each register has a name and a textual description. Offset specifies the location of the 
			register from the start of the containing address block expressed as number of addressing units.
			Size defines the number of bits the register contains. Dimension assigns an unbounded dimension to
			the register. Volatile value of true indicates that register value may change without a write 
			operation to it, i.e. by an interrupt event.
		</p>
		<p>
			Access column specifies the accessibility of the register, the possible values are:
			<ul>
				<li>Read-write</li>
				<li>Read-only</li>
				<li>Write-only</li>
				<li>Read-writeOnce</li>
				<li>writeOnce</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The reset value column contains the registerâ€™s value on reset. Reset mask defines the bits of
			the register that have a known reset value. Bit value of 1 means that the corresponding bit has a 
			known reset value. 0 means that the value is unknown.

    <h2>Address block editor</h2>
    <p>
      Address block editor is used to edit the details of an address block by defining registers to it. Each row
      in the editor specifies a single register within the containing address block. The <b>name</b>,
      <b>display name</b> and a <b>description</b> contain identification information of an address block.
      <br /><b>Usage</b> specifies the usage of the address block (mandatory).
      <br /><b>Base address</b> specifies the starting address for the address block, expressed as address unit
        bits (mandatory, can be given as an expression).
      <br /><b>Range</b> specifies the size of the block, expressed as address unit bits (mandatory, can be given
        as an expression).
      <br /><b>Width</b> is the data width in bits of a row in the address block (mandatory, can be given as an
        expression).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Access</b> specifies the accessability of the block.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>read-write</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this address block.</li>
        <li><i>read-only</i>. Only read transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><i>write-only</i>. Only write transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><i>read-writeOnce</i>. Read actions and the first write action may have an effect on this address
            block.</li>
        <li><i>writeOnce</i>. Only the first write action affects the contents of this address block.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Volatile</b>=true indicates that the stored value may change without the master's write operation.
    </p>
    <h3>Registers table</h3>
    <p>
      The register table enables the user to define registers for the address block. Each register has a
      <b>name</b> and a textual <b>description</b>. <br><b>Offset</b> specifies the location of
      the register from the start of the containing address block
      expressed as number of addressing units. The actual address of
      the register is the sum of address block's base addr and
      register offset. E.g. if base addr=0x100 and reg has offset=0x4,
      then register's address=0x104.<br><b>Size</b> defines the
      number of data bits the register contains. It must be less or
      equal to <i>Width</i> of the address
      space. <br><b>Dimension</b> assigns an unbounded dimension to
      the register. Its semantics are the same as the C language
      standard for the layout of memory in multidimensional
      arrays. <br><b>Volatile</b>=true indicates that register value
      may change without a write operation to it, i.e. by an interrupt
      event.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Access</b> column specifies the accessibility of the register, the
      possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>read-write</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this register.</li>
      <li><i>read-only</i>. Only read transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
      <li><i>write-only</i>. Only write transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
      <li><i>read-writeOnce</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this register. Only the
          first write transaction, after an event that caused the reset value of the register to be loaded, may
          affet the contents of the register, and read transactions return a value related to the values in the
          register.</li>
      <li><i>writeOnce</i>. Only the first write transaction affects the contents of the register.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Reset value</b> defines register's value on reset and
      <b>Reset mask</b> defines the bits of the register that have a
      known reset value. Bit value of 1 means that the corresponding
      bit has a known reset value, whereas 0 means that the value is
      unknown. Both use SystemVerilog syntax for binary values e.g.
      'b1011, 4'b1011, and 4'b10_11 are all valid values. The number
      of bits must equal the register <i>size</i>.

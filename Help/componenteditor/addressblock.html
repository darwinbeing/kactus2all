    <h2>Address block editor</h2>
    <p>
      Address block editor is used to edit the details of an address
      block by defining registers to it. Each row in the editor
      specifies a single register within the containing address block.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each register has a <b>name</b> and a textual
      <b>description</b>. <br><b>Offset</b> specifies the location of
      the register from the start of the containing address block
      expressed as number of addressing units. The actual address of
      the register is the sum of address block's base addr and
      register offset. E.g. if base addr=0x100 and reg has offset=0x4,
      then register's address=0x104.<br><b>Size</b> defines the
      number of data bits the register contains. It must be less or
      equal to <i>Width</i> of the address
      space. <br><b>Dimension</b> assigns an unbounded dimension to
      the register. Its semantics are the same as the C language
      standard for the layout of memory in multidimensional
      arrays. <br><b>Volatile</b>=true indicates that register value
      may change without a write operation to it, i.e. by an interrupt
      event.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Access</b> column specifies the accessibility of the register, the
      possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read-write</li>
      <li>Read-only</li>
      <li>Write-only</li>
      <li>Read-writeOnce</li>
      <li>writeOnce</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Reset value</b> defines register's value on reset and
      <b>Reset mask</b> defines the bits of the register that have a
      known reset value. Bit value of 1 means that the corresponding
      bit has a known reset value, whereas 0 means that the value is
      unknown. Both use SystemVerilog syntax for binary values e.g.
      'b1011, 4'b1011, and 4'b10_11 are all valid values. The number
      of bits must equal the register <i>size</i>.

    <h2>Channels editor</h2>
    <p>
      Channels editor provides a summary of the channels contained in
      the component. Channel is used within a bus component to
      describe which bus interfaces are connected via bus. This editor
      can be used to add, edit and remove channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name and description columns contain the name and textual
      description of the channel. Interface references contain the
      names of the mirrored bus interfaces that are grouped to a same
      channel. Picture below illustrates the connections between
      mirrored bus interfaces.<br> <img

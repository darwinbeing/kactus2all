    <h2>Register editor</h2>
    <p>
      Register editor is used to edit the details of a single register
      by assigning bit fields to a containing register. A bit field
      may contain just one bit, the whole register or something in
      between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Field has a <b>name</b> and a textual
      <b>description</b>. <b>Offset</b> describes the starting bit of
      the field within the containing register. <b>Width</b> specifies
      how many bits are included in the field. Name, offset, and width
      are mandatory. <br> <b>Volatile</b>= true indicates that there
      is no guarantee that two consecutive read operations will return
      the same value because the register may change its value without
      write operations i.e. as a result of an interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Access</b> column specifies the accessibility of the field,
      the possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>read-write</i></li>
      <li><i>read-only</i></li>
      <li><i>write-only</i></li>
      <li><i>read-writeOnce</i></li>
      <li><i>writeOnce</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <b>Modified write value</b> describes how the data in the field is
    manipulated on a write operation. The basic operation without any
    setting is to store the written value 'as is'. Moreover, both
    bitwise and field-wise set/clear/toggle is also possbile. The
    possible values are:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt> <i>oneToClear</i></dt>
      <dd>- each written '1' bit will assign the corresponding bit to '0'.</dd>
      <dt> <i>oneToSet</i></dt>
      <dd>- each written '1' bit will assign the corresponding bit to '1'.</dd>
      <dt><i>oneToToggle</i></dt>
      <dd>- each written '1' bit will toggle the corresponding bit.</dd>
      <dt><i>zeroToClear, zeroToSet, zeroToToggle</i></dt>
      <dd>- similar to previous ones, except that written '0' bit triggers the action
      <dt><i>clear</i></dt>
      <dd>- each write operation will clear all bits in the field to '0'.</dd>
      <dt><i>set</i></dt>
      <dd>- each write operation will set all bits in the field to '1'.</dd>
      <dt><i>modify</i></dt>
      <dd>- indicates that after a write operation all bits in the field can be modified.</dd>
      <dt><i>'&nbsp; ' (empty setting)</i></dt>
      <dd>- indicates that the value written to a field is the value stored in the field. This is the default.</dd>
    </dl>


    <p>
      <br><b>Read action</b> specifies if some action happens to the
      field after a read operation. By default the register is
      unmodified. the possible values are:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><i>clear</i></dt>
      <dd>- all bits in the field are cleared to '0' after a read operation.</dd>
      <dt><i>set</i></dt>
      <dd>- all bits in the field are set to '1' after a read operation.</dd>
      <dt><i>modify</i></dt>
      <dd>- indicates that the bits in the field are modified in some way after a read operation.</dd>
      <dt><i>'&nbsp; ' (empty setting)</i></dt>
      <dd>- indicates that field is not modified after a read operation. This is the default.</dd>				
    </dl>
    <p>
      <br><b>Testable</b> specifies if the field is testable by an
      automated register test. <b>Test constraint</b> specifies the
      constraints for the automated tests for the field, the possible
      values are:
    </p>
    <dl>

      <dt><i>unConstrained</i></dt>
      <dd>- there are no constraints for the written or read data. This is the default setting.</dd>
      <dt><i>restore</i></dt>
      <dd>- the field's value must be restored to its original value before accessing another register.</dd>
      <dt><i>writeAsRead</i></dt>
      <dd>- the data written to a field must be same that was read previously from the field.</dd>
      <dt><i>readOnly</i></dt>
      <dd>- indicates that the field can only be read.</dd>				
    </dl>

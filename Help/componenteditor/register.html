		<h2>Register editor</h2>
		<p>
			Register editor is used to edit the details of a single register by assigning bit fields to a 
			containing register. A bit field may contain just one bit, the whole register or something in between.
		</p>
		<p>
			Field contains a name and a textual description. Offset describes the starting bit of the field 
			within the containing register. Width specifies how many bits are included in the field.
			Volatile value of true indicates that there is no guarantee what a read operation will return 
			because the register may change its value without write operations i.e. as a result of an interrupt.
		</p>
		<p>
			Access column specifies the accessibility of the field, the possible values are:
			<ul>
				<li>Read-write</li>
				<li>Read-only</li>
				<li>Write-only</li>
				<li>Read-writeOnce</li>
				<li>writeOnce</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			<dl>The modified write value describes how the data in the field is manipulated on a write operation.
			The possible values are:
				<dt><strong>oneToClear</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that each data bit of one written to a field will set the corresponding bit to zero.</dd>
				<dt><strong>oneToSet</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that each data bit of one written to a field will set the corresponding bit to one.</dd>
				<dt><strong>oneToToggle</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that each data bit of one written to a field will toggle the corresponding bit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>zeroToClear</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that each data bit of zero written to a field will set the corresponding bit to zero.</dd>
				<dt><strong>zeroToSet</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that each data bit of zero written to a field will set the corresponding bit to one.</dd>
				<dt><strong>zeroToToggle</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that each data bit of zero written will toggle the corresponding bit.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Clear</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that each write operation will clear all bits in the field.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Set</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that each write operation will set all bits in the field.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Modify</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that after a write operation all bits in the field can be modified.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Empty setting</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that the value written to a field is the value stored in the field</dd>
			</dl>
		</p>
		<p>
			<dl>Read action specifies the action that happens to the field after a read operation, the possible values are:
				<dt><strong>Clear</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that all bits in the field are cleared after a read operation.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Set</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that all bits in the field are set after a read operation.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Modify</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that the bits in the field are modified in some way after a read operation.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Empty setting</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that field is not modified after a read operation.</dd>				
			</dl>
		</p>
		<p>
			<dl>Testable specifies if the field is testable by an automated register test. 
			Test constraint specifies the constraints for the automated tests for the field, the possible values are:
				<dt><strong>unConstrained</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that there are no constraints for the written or read data. This is the default setting.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Restore</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that the fields value must be restored to its original value before accessing another register.</dd>
				<dt><strong>writeAsRead</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that the data written to a field must be same that was read previously from the field.</dd>
				<dt><strong>readOnly</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicates that the field can only be read.</dd>				
			</dl>

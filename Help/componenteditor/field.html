		<h2>Field editor</h2>
		<p>
			The field editor is used to edit the details of a field. For example user may define enumerated
			values that define the legal bit patterns of a field.
		</p>
		<p>
			The enumerated values table enables user the define bit patterns that can be identified by a name. 
			This can be used to define the legal bit patterns for a field or to define some default settings 
			to help configuration of the field.
		</p>
		<p>
			<dl>The write value constraints are used to define what are the legal values user may write to a field, the options are:
				<dt><strong>No constraints</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicating that there are no constraints to values to be written.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Write as read</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicating that only legal values to be written are the same that were previously read from the field.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Use enumerated values</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicating that the defined enumerated values are the only legal values that can be written.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Set minimum and maximum limits</strong></dt>
				<dd>- indicating that user may set the minimum and maximum limits for the values written to the field.</dd>

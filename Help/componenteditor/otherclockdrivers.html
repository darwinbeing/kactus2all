		<h2>Other clock drivers editor</h2>
		<p>
			Other clock drivers-editor shows the clocks within the component that are not directly associated with a top-level port.
			This kind of clocks could be i.e. virtual clocks or generated clocks. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The clock name specifies the name of the clock and the clock source the physical path and name of the clock generation cell. 
			The rest of the columns are used to describe the waveform of the clock signal. 
			The time units are either <strong>ps</strong> (picosecond) or <strong>ns</strong> (nanosecond). 
		</p>
		<p>
			The clock period defines the length of one cycle of clock pulse. Pulse offset describes the time delay from start 
			of the pulse to the first transition. Pulse value defines the logic value which the transition is made to. 
			Pulse duration specifies how long the value defined in pulse value is held.
		</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Add new clock (Add row)</li>
				<li>Remove clock (Remove row)</li>
				<li>Clear the selected cells</li>

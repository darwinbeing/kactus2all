+ Added the possibility to select which C source file to open through the
  system design editor when right-clicking an application component.

* Double-clicking an SW platform component in the platform stack editor now
  opens up the hierarchy if it exists and the component editor only if it
  does not exists (meaning a flat component).
* Removed the always repeating question of whether the user wants to add
  the generated VHDL-file to IP-XACT meta-data if it already exists there.
* Docking windows are now kept visible based on the user's selection of
  what windows to show/hide.
